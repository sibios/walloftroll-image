No NSFW images here.  Check images.json for references to classic shock-site images for your installation.  :)

The server will search the image store for directories named 'nsfw' and map them into a separate directory structure.  This intended to allow the client to run in a clearly defined NSFW/SFW mode depending on the venue and intent.
